## Application function

### All features of this application do not need to connect to the server. After opening this application, you will be able to use the following features:

- Employee attendance based on face detection
- Information registration and face entry for new employees
- Set the attendance time interval
- Verify the fingerprint to ensure the process is self-operating
- Automatically exclude the same employee from checking in repeatedly
- Fuzzy search of employee information based on a job number or name
- View employees attendance history
- Thorough Simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese and English support
- Quick entry(App shortcuts)
- More……

### After opening the application egg, you will get the following additional features:

- Delete employee information in a single/bulk
- Deleted employee information can be withdrawn in a short time
- Modify the employee information that has been entered

## Precautions

- All major functions can be switched by swiping the pop-up side-slip menu to the right.
- This app will only apply for **Camera** permissions on your device. Individual ROMs will prompt the app to request additional permissions. You can choose to ignore or deny permissions.
- Since this application does not rely on the server, you must manually enter the settings before the start of the new attendance date to clear the employee's previous attendance mark.
- The default operation after fingerprint verification is the user's own operation, so please clear the activity of **FaceAttendance** in the background after exiting.
- This application only passes the real machine test on Huawei Mate 9. For some reasons, the face detection frame of the mobile phone device of other models will be offset, but this may not affect the normal use.
